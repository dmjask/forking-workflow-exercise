# Cauliflower tacos

This recipe is taken as an example from https://github.com/sinker/tacofancy/blob/master/full_tacos/cauliflower_tacos.md.

We are avid meat eaters, but these vegetarian tacos are one of our go-to's in
Peru. If you can make the pickles with Peruvian aji amarillo, please do.

- Roasted cauliflower
- Pickled chilis and vegetables
- Caramelized red onions
- Guacamole
- Yogurt
- Tortilla of choice, warmed in a dry pan

1. Obliterate cauliflower into bits and charr
2. Chop chilis and veg until they beg for mercy
3. Stab red onions and light on fire until sweet
4. Make guac (:
5. Proclaim milk of the holy goat and harvest wild bacteria hoping they will make yoghurt
6. Get storebought tortillas, homemade failures are also fine
